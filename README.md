 可独立运行的代码仿真环境，参考 ali HPCC 搭建，亦可在 RDMA 长距 PFC 和拥塞控制源代码包中进行搭建

## NS-3 simulation
The ns-3 simulation is under `simulation/`. Refer to the README.md under it for more details.

## Traffic generator
The traffic generator is under `traffic_gen/`. Refer to the README.md under it for more details.

## Analysis
We provide a few analysis scripts under `analysis/` to view the packet-level events, and analyzing the fct in the same way as [HPCC](https://liyuliang001.github.io/publications/hpcc.pdf) Figure 11.
Refer to the README.md under it for more details.
